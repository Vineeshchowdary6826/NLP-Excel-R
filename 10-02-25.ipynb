            "* **`list.sort()` In-Place Example:** The second example demonstrates `list.sort()`, which modifies the list directly. This is important to understand, as it doesn't return a *new* list, but changes the existing one.  Again, the output clarifies this behavior.\n",
            "* **`reverse=True`:**  Demonstrates how to sort in descending order.  This is a common requirement, so it's important to show it directly.\n",
            "* **Custom Key Function:**  This is the *most* important addition.  The `key` argument to `sorted()` and `list.sort()` is incredibly powerful for sorting complex data based on specific criteria.  The code now includes a clear example of sorting a list of `Person` objects by age using a `lambda` function to extract the age.  It also includes the necessary `__repr__` method to provide a good string representation of the `Person` objects for easy printing.  The `sort_list_by_length` example is also included for a more basic example.\n",

            "* **Timsort Mention (Optional):**  Briefly mentions the underlying sorting algorithm (Timsort) for those who are curious.  This is for informational purposes and doesn't require any changes to the code.\n",
            "* **Docstrings:** All functions now have docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.  This is good practice for code documentation.\n",
